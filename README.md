# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in C. The game allows a user to play against the computer, which makes random choices. The user inputs their choice (r for Rock, p for Paper, s for Scissor), and the computer randomly selects one of the three options. The game then determines the winner based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors and displays the result.
